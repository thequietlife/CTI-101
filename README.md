## Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Over the last two years I have learnt alot about cybersecurity from a wide range of sources - working at a cybersecurity startup, going to SecTalks, conferences, studying at TAFE, reading articles, books and watching YouTube videos. To move into a CTI role I need one location to store and showcase my knowledge.

I have gone through a stack of CTI analyst job ads to find the skills hiring managers want.

I have also used Katie Nickels and Andy Piazza's Cyber Threat Intelligence study plans as a guide.
