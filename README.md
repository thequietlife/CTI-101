# Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Notes from learning CTI. I have used Katie Nickels [A Cyber Threat Intelligence Self-Study Plan](https://medium.com/katies-five-cents/a-cyber-threat-intelligence-self-study-plan-part-1-968b5a8daf9a) and Andy Piazza's [Cyber Threat Intelligence Study Plan](https://klrgrz.medium.com/cyber-threat-intelligence-study-plan-c60484d319cb) as guides. I have also gone through a stack of CTI analyst job ads to find the skills hiring managers want.
