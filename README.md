# Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Notes from learning CTI. I have used Katie Nickels [A Cyber Threat Intelligence Self-Study Plan](https://medium.com/katies-five-cents/a-cyber-threat-intelligence-self-study-plan-part-1-968b5a8daf9a) and Andy Piazza's [Cyber Threat Intelligence Study Plan](https://klrgrz.medium.com/cyber-threat-intelligence-study-plan-c60484d319cb) as guides. I have also gone through a stack of CTI analyst job ads to find the skills hiring managers want.

### Basics - [Computer Science (CS) 101](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/)

### Computer Software

#### Applications
* e.g. Mozilla Firefox - consists of 20 million machine code instructions

#### Intro to Code
+ve of computers - can process a lot of information quickly, accurately <br>
-ve of computers - only does what is asked, it is not a human brain with a will of its own

#### How Computers Work
* code is step by step instructions for a computer to follow

#### Computers
* stupid but useful
  
#### Developers
* link the code and computer together
* when creating a new feature a developer uses their knowledge of computers, creativity and insights about user needs
* developers work out each step and write it in code for the computer
  
#### First Code Operation
* Javascript
* print("hello, world")

#### Bugs
* syntax and logic errors

#### ASCII Art
print (" *   * ")

#### Programming Languages
* rules for the code
* high level through to low level

#### Types of Programming Languages
* Compiled
* Interpreted

#### Programming Languages: Source Code
* editable
* licence to **use** the software, not change it

#### Open Source in Theory
* free to use
* Richard Stallman, Free Software Movement
* Linux

#### Open Source in Practice
* right to modify
* all developers can contribute

#### The Operating System
* e.g. Apple Mac macOS Sequoia 15.0.1 and Microsoft Windows 11
* boot-up process starts when a computer is switched on
* manages the starting, running, stopping of programs
* ensures all resources are released when a program ends
* sandboxing of programs
* allows software updates

#### Lifecycle of a Program
* loads the program
* each program gets its own **memory**

#### Ending Programs
* user closes program
* program glitches "not responding"
* running out of memory
* program tries to access the memory of another program (corrupted data)

#### OS: Reboot
* why does this work?
*   fixes a bug in the OS or hardware error
*   rebooting wipes all the memory
*   in theory not needed but in reality it seems to work a lot

#### Architecture: Machine Code
* architecture is like a guide, it helps the computer understand what to do
* each line of machine code is like one step in a recipe
* Javascript gets converted into machine code
* machine code is written in **binary**
