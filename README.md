## Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Over the last two years I have learnt alot about cybersecurity from a wide range of sources - working at a cybersecurity startup, going to SecTalks, conferences, studying at TAFE, reading articles, books and watching YouTube videos. To move into a CTI role I need one location to store and showcase my knowledge.

I have gone through a stack of CTI analyst job ads to find the skills hiring managers want.

I have also used Katie Nickels [A Cyber Threat Intelligence Self-Study Plan](https://medium.com/katies-five-cents/a-cyber-threat-intelligence-self-study-plan-part-1-968b5a8daf9a) and Andy Piazza's [Cyber Threat Intelligence Study Plan](https://klrgrz.medium.com/cyber-threat-intelligence-study-plan-c60484d319cb) as guides.
