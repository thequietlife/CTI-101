### Basics - [Computer Science (CS) 101](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs101/)

### Computer Software

#### Applications
* e.g. Mozilla Firefox - consists of 20 million machine code instructions

#### Intro to Code
+ve of computers - can process a lot of information quickly, accurately <br>
-ve of computers - only does what is asked, it is not a human brain with a will of its own

#### How Computers Work
* code is step by step instructions for a computer to follow

#### Computers
* stupid but useful
  
#### Developers
* link the code and computer together
* when creating a new feature a developer uses their knowledge of computers, creativity and insights about user needs
* developers work out each step and write it in code for the computer
  
#### First Code Operation
* Javascript
* print("hello, world")

#### Bugs
* syntax and logic errors

#### ASCII Art
print (" *   * ")

#### Programming Languages
* rules for the code
* high level through to low level

#### Types of Programming Languages
* Compiled
* Interpreted

#### Programming Languages: Source Code
* editable
* licence to **use** the software, not change it

#### Open Source in Theory
* free to use
* Richard Stallman, Free Software Movement
* Linux

#### Open Source in Practice
* right to modify
* all developers can contribute

#### The Operating System
* e.g. Apple Mac macOS Sequoia 15.0.1 and Microsoft Windows 11
* boot-up process starts when a computer is switched on
* manages the starting, running, stopping of programs
* ensures all resources are released when a program ends
* sandboxing of programs
* allows software updates

#### Lifecycle of a Program
* loads the program
* each program gets its own **memory**

#### Ending Programs
* user closes program
* program glitches "not responding"
* running out of memory
* program tries to access the memory of another program (corrupted data)

#### OS: Reboot
* why does this work?
*   fixes a bug in the OS or hardware error
*   rebooting wipes all the memory
*   in theory not needed but in reality it seems to work a lot

#### Architecture: Machine Code
* architecture is like a guide, it helps the computer understand what to do
* each line of machine code is like one step in a recipe
* Javascript gets converted into machine code
* machine code is written in **binary**

### Computer Hardware
* Physical parts of a computer

#### Central Processing Unit (CPU) 
* microprocessor
* the belle of the ball
* in every computer
* not just one chip, it has three main components
  - control unit: assigns tasks
  - logic unit: in charge of math tasks
  - memory unit: responsible for memory usage
* fetches, decodes and executes

#### Chips and Transistors
* Big business selling CPUs
* Intel, AMD, Apple, NVIDIA make CPUs
* CPUs are made of a multitude of transistors
* Apple's M2 has 20 billion transistors
* transistors are like a digital switch
* solid state = no moving parts
* Moore's Law (Gordon Moore, Intel cofounder) = number of transistors on a chip doubles every few years. Compare M1 to M2

#### Memory
* a storage area for bytes
* two types
  - Random Access Memory (RAM)
  - Persistent Storage
 
#### RAM
* not persistent, if you are working in github and the power glitches, you only have up to where you last committed changes
* when you hover over a browser tab you can see the memory usage (198MB)

#### Persistent Storage
* saved even when not switched on
* e.g.  hard drive, flash drive, Solid State Disk (SSD)

#### Circuits
* helps make a toy train move
* made up of digital logic gates
    - AND gate
    - OR gate
    - XOR gate
    - NOT gate
      
AND gate: ðŸ’¡ ðŸ’¡ both switches need to be on for the light to shine <br>
OR gate: ðŸ’¡ the light shines if at least one switch is on <br>
XOR gate: ðŸ’¡ the light shines if one switch is on but not both <br> 
NOT gate: topsy turvy time. if the switch is off, the light shines ðŸ’¡<br>

#### The Operating System: All the elements pulled together
