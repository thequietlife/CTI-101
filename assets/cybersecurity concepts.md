### Definitions: 

**Cybersecurity**: Technologies, processes, policies and training that help protect networks, devices and data from cyberattacks, damage and unauthorized access. <br>

**Cyber Attack**: To manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy computers, networks, or the information they contain, with the aim of significantly undermining national security, stability, or economic prosperity.

An attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system to cause damage or harm...a cyber attack can occur on almost any modern digital device. An attacker can use people, computers, applications, messages and system processes to carry out an attack. 

Examples:
- [2015 Ukraine power grid hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Ukraine_power_grid_hack), infiltrating the control systems of a country's electricity grid, causing widespread blackouts
- Lock data and demand a ransom
- Remove vital information to cause serious harm
- Steal information
- Publicly expose private information
- Stop vital business processes and systems from running <br>

Attackers don't need a computer to carry out an attack. Attacks can vary widely in their nature and scope. <br>

**Threat Actor**: An individual or group that conducts malicious activity, such as cyber espionage, cyber attacks or cyber-enabled crime. <br>

**Threat Actor Type**: 

| Type | Motivation |
|------|------------|
| Cybercriminal | Financial |
| Hacktivist | Put spotlight on their cause |
| Nation-State / Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Actors | Sabotage, gathering intelligence, financial |
| Insiders | Revenge, whistle blower |
| Script Kiddies | Reputation |
| Internal User Mistakes / User Error | Accidental |

**Threat Landscape**: Whether an organisation is large or small, the entirety of the digital landscape with which it interacts represents an entry point for a cyber attack. These can include:
- Email accounts
- Social media accounts
- Mobile devices
- Organisation's technology infrastructure
- Cloud services
- People. <br>

### What are Attack Vectors?**
An attack vector is an entry point or route for an attacker to gain access to a system. Examples:
- Email
- Social media
- Web browsers
- Cloud services
- Insider threats
- Devices that are not secured, e.g. IOT devices
- Wireless. <br>

**Common Attack Vectors**
- Email is one of the most common attack vectors, e.g. clicking on a link
- Threat actors will often tap into public and unsecured Wi-Fi networks, for example at airports or hotels.

**Less Common Attack Vectors**
- Removable media: attackers might load malicious code into USB devices provided to users as a free gift or left in public spaces to be found
- Web browsers: attackers can use malicious websites or browser extensions to get users to dowload malicious code onto their devices. This can provide an entry point to the wider network
- Cloud services: attackers can compromise poorly secured resources or services in the cloud, e.g. compromise an account in a cloud service or gain control of any resources or services availalble to that account. They could also gain access to another account with even more permissions.
- Insiders: the employees of an organisation can serve as an attack vector in a cyber attack, intentionally or not. **Social Engineering Attack**: An attacker may impersonate a person of authority to gain unauthorised access to a system.<br>
