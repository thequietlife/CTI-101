### Definitions: 

**Cybersecurity**: Technologies, processes, policies and training that help protect networks, devices and data from cyberattacks, damage and unauthorized access. <br>

**Cyber Attack**: To manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy computers, networks, or the information they contain, with the aim of significantly undermining national security, stability, or economic prosperity.

An attempt to gain illegal access to a computer or computer system to cause damage or harm...a cyber attack can occur on almost any modern digital device. An attacker can use people, computers, applications, messages and system processes to carry out an attack. 

Examples:
- [2015 Ukraine power grid hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Ukraine_power_grid_hack), infiltrating the control systems of a country's electricity grid, causing widespread blackouts
- Lock data and demand a ransom
- Remove vital information to cause serious harm
- Steal information
- Publicly expose private information
- Stop vital business processes and systems from running <br>

Attackers don't need a computer to carry out an attack. Attacks can vary widely in their nature and scope. <br>

**Threat Actor**: An individual or group that conducts malicious activity, such as cyber espionage, cyber attacks or cyber-enabled crime. <br>

**Threat Actor Type**: 

| Type | Motivation |
|------|------------|
| Cybercriminal | Financial |
| Hacktivist | Put spotlight on their cause |
| Nation-State / Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Actors | Sabotage, gathering intelligence, financial |
| Insiders | Revenge, whistle blower |
| Script Kiddies | Reputation |
| Internal User Mistakes / User Error | Accidental |

**Threat Landscape**: Whether an organisation is large or small, the entirety of the digital landscape with which it interacts represents an entry point for a cyber attack. These can include:
- Email accounts
- Social media accounts
- Mobile devices
- Organisation's technology infrastructure
- Cloud services
- People. 

### What are Attack Vectors? 
An attack vector is an entry point or route for an attacker to gain access to a system. Examples:
- Email
- Social media
- Web browsers
- Cloud services
- Insider threats
- Devices that are not secured, e.g. IOT devices
- Wireless. 

**Common Attack Vectors**
- Email is one of the most common attack vectors, e.g. clicking on a link
- Threat actors will often tap into public and unsecured Wi-Fi networks, for example at airports or hotels.

**Less Common Attack Vectors**
- Removable media: attackers might load malicious code into USB devices provided to users as a free gift or left in public spaces to be found
- Web browsers: attackers can use malicious websites or browser extensions to get users to dowload malicious code onto their devices. This can provide an entry point to the wider network
- Cloud services: attackers can compromise poorly secured resources or services in the cloud, e.g. compromise an account in a cloud service or gain control of any resources or services availalble to that account. They could also gain access to another account with even more permissions.
- Insiders: the employees of an organisation can serve as an attack vector in a cyber attack, intentionally or not. **Social Engineering Attack**: An attacker may impersonate a person of authority to gain unauthorised access to a system.<br>

### Security Breaches
- Definition
- Types

**Definition**: Any attack that results in someone gaining unauthorised access to devices, services or networks. Think of an intruder breaking in to a building, getting in through an open window.

**Some Types of Attacks**:
üü• Social Engineering Attacks <br>
üü• Browser Attacks <br>
üü• Password Attacks <br>


üü• Social Engineering Attacks
- Attacks can use social enginnering attacks to exploit or manipulate users into granting them unauthorised access to a system. For example, a cybercriminal might pretend to be have an enticing job offer or presentation opportunity. <br>

üü• Browser Attacks 
- If a team member (user) is working on a tight deadline and goes to a website for a solution. The website could ask the user to make changes to their browser settings so they can install an add-o. The user follows the instructions on the website. Now their website is compromised. The attacker can now use the browser to steal information, monitor user behaviour or compromise a device. This is referred to as a Browser Modifier Attack. <br>

üü• Password Attacks <br>
- A password attack is when someone attempts to use authentication for a password protected account to gain unauthorised access to a device or system. Attackers often use password cracking tools. This is referred to as a Brute Force Attack.

‚ö†Ô∏è**Data Breaches**
A data breach happens when personal information is accessed, disclosed without authorisation, or is lost. For example, when:

- a USB or mobile phone that holds a individual‚Äôs personal information is stolen
- a database containing personal information is hacked
- someone‚Äôs personal information is sent to the wrong person
  
A data breach can harm an individual whose personal information is affected. They can, for example, suffer distress or financial loss.


### Malware in the Building

Malicious software (Malware) made by cybercriminals to steal data, infect systems and/or damage a network. Usually added covertly with the aim of disrupting the victim. <br>

There are **two broad components** of malware: 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Propagnation Mechanism, how it spreads or propagates
2Ô∏è‚É£ Payload, the actions it performs once a target is reached <br>

1Ô∏è‚É£ Propagnation Mechanism <br>

**Examples**: <br>
-  Virus, download a file
-  Worm, doesn't need any user action to spread itself
-  Trojan, pretends to be a genuine piece of software <br>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Payload <br>
**Examples**: <br>
- Ransomware
- Spyware
- Back doors
- Botnet

**Ransomware**is a payload that locks systems or data until the victim has paid a ransom <br>
**Spyware** a type of payload that spies on a device or system, e.g. a cybercriminal infiltrates a software company and leaves some code that allows them to carry out attacks. This becomes a back door that the attacker could use to hack into the application <br>
**Botnet** joins a computer, server or another device to a network of similiarly infected devices that can be controlled remotely, e.g. crypto-mining - the malware connects a device to a botnet that consumes the device's computing power to mine or generate cryptocurrencies. <br>

**Basic Mitigation Strategies**
üü¢ Multi-factor authentication
üü¢ Browser security
üü¢ Educate users
üü¢ Threat intelligence
