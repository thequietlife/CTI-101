## Cryptography
- The study and use of methods to protect messages by turning readable information (plaintext) into scrambled code (ciphertext) using a cipher. The original message can only be decoded with the correct cryptographic key.

**Encryption** is the process of converting data so that only the intended recipient can read it.


### Encryption Standards

* Symmetric encryption: uses a single secret key 
- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) replaces the Data Encryption Standard (DES)
- AES encrypts 128-bit data

  
* Asymmetric encryption also known as Public Key Cryptography
- Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) uses two keys, a public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt data
