## üñäÔ∏è Pen-To-Paper and The Finished Report: The Key To Generating Threat Intelligence - Christian Paredes 

### Notes from Christian Paredes' SANS DFIR CTI Summit 2017 Presentation
_______

## Main Argument / BLUF
* Finished reporting is the only way to:
   - memorialise analysis; make it transparent and accessible to the people who have to make decisions
   - preserve knowledge
   - create accountability

### Notes

* Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg "The astronomer's rule of thumb: if you don't write it down it didn't happen."

* What are the components of good threat intel
* The goal is to have actionable intel
* There is a big gap between analysis and action. How do we tie them together?
* **Consumption** is tough. There is a lot of data. But there are tools to help us consume
* Tools: **threat intelligence platforms** - designed to collect and centralise data
* **Requirements** can help you scope your collection and scope your consumption
* Collect data that helps answer a question
* **Analysis** is where we show value. We start to see patterns, outliers, start making judgments about the data and coming up with cool insights
* Somewhere between analysis and action, we hope our stakeholders will do something with that information. But if the information is only in our heads, what are our stakeholders taking action on?
* The assessments in our heads, our knowledge of threats and what we know and what we think about threats is how we can show value to our organisations


### What is the missing link between analysis and action?
- the finished report

* Finished reporting is the only way to preserve analysis and what we think about threats
* Preserve that knowledge forever. Once you write it down on paper it is there forever and the benefit of that is that our knowledge becomes transparent and it becomes accessible to the people who need to make decisions
* Creates accountability. If we expect people to make decisions based on the intel that we are providing them and our analysis is willy-nilly and we are influencing bad decisions or bad outcomes. Then we need to be held accountable that analysis
* We need to write and commit to putting pen to paper

* Writing, the blank screen is a daunting challenge. We might feel overwhelmed or frustrated because there is so much information that we have to synthesise and assimiliate and that is very difficult to do

* The good news is that this is a totally rational feeling

### Three underlying challenges to putting pen to paper

alt="slide which states three challenges - process faults, cognitive limitations, complexity of threat" width="300"/>

1. Our process needs to improve
2. Cognitive limitations that we need to be aware of
3. The threats we deal with are really, really complex
