## üñäÔ∏è Threat Intel for Everyone: Writing Like A Journalist To Produce Clear, Concise Reports - Selena Larson

**Notes from Selena Larson's SANS CTI Summit 2021 Presentation**

_______

### Role of CTI

* A crucial part of CTI is explaining things to a broad audience. Taking important subjects and packaging them in an effective and easy to understand way
* Subreddit r/Explain Like I'm Five (ELI5) - a concept that can help people better communicate their expertise to a wide audience
* Write for an eighth-grade reading level
* CTI is for everyone, make it easier for customers to read, spread and act on. E.g. A threat actor is using LinkedIn (LI) for open source intelligence information gathering as well as spear phishing. Finding employees working on specific projects or finding the different software services that are used at an organisation. Based on job postings or people's profiles on LI. That threat intel can be operationalised across an organisation, delivered to the HR department. So HR teams can decide what type of information they should be sharing on LI, coming up with new policies or restrictions for information sharing for employees and thinking about how they can better protect themselves from this particular threat

### Concepts journalists learn (focused on news writing)

Parallels between threat intelligence writing and journalism. 

**Inverted Pyramid of News**

**Who, What, Where, When, Why, How**
* The most important info, shared succinctly
* Readers should quickly understand what the report is about and why it matters
* In CTI:
  - Adversary
  - Malware
  - Victim
  - Timing
  - **Why it matters to your customers**
