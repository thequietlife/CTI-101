## üñäÔ∏è Threat Intel for Everyone: Writing Like A Journalist To Produce Clear, Concise Reports - Selena Larson

**Notes from Selena Larson's SANS CTI Summit 2021 Presentation**

_______

### Key elements of writing CTI reports

* A crucial part of CTI is explaining things to a broad audience. Taking important subjects and packaging them in an effective and easy to understand way
* Subreddit r/Explain Like I'm Five (ELI5) - a concept that can help people better communicate their expertise to a wide audience
* Write for an eighth-grade reading level
* CTI is for everyone, make it easier for customers to read, spread and act on. Example:
  - A threat actor is using LinkedIn (LI) for open source intelligence information gathering as well as spear phishing. Finding employees working on specific projects or finding the different software services that are used at an organisation. Based on job postings or people's profiles on LI. That threat intel can be operationalised across an organisation, delivered to the HR department. So HR teams can decide what type of information they should be sharing on LI, coming up with new policies or restrictions for information sharing for employees and thinking about how they can better protect themselves from this particular threat

### Concepts journalists learn (focused on news writing)

Parallels between threat intelligence writing and journalism. 

**Inverted Pyramid of News**

* A structure for framing news writing
* How to effectively communicate and get that information across

alt="upside down triangle - top bit: Who, What, Where, When, Why, How; middle section of triangle: Supporting information and additional facts. Tip of triangle (bottom): Detailed, in-depth info" width="300"/>

**Who, What, Where, When, Why, How**
* The most important info, shared succinctly. Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF)
* Readers should quickly understand what the report is about and why it matters
* In CTI:
  - Adversary
  - Malware
  - Victim
  - Timing
  - **Why it matters to your customers/stakeholders/audience** e.g. highlighting potential impact to xyz

**Supporting information and additional facts**
* Additional details that support the essential elements of information
* In CTI:
  - Tactics, techniques, and procedures: the how, where and the why getting fleshed out a little bit more
  - Information for defenders: actions that can be taken to prevent an attack, to recover from an attack, information for proactive defence

**Detailed, in-depth info**
* Can be deleted without changing the meaning or point of a story
* In CTI:
  - Depending on the audience, this can include technical malware analysis, attribution, related activity
  - Background information not for operational use


**Headlines aslo referred to by journalists as Head (Hed)**
* You want to provide as much information in as few words as possible
* You want the reader to learn something and want to continue to read the report
* Report titles = Headline
* Use of "How" indicates the reader will learn something. Example:
  - [How U.S. agencies‚Äô trust in untested software opened the door to hackers](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/19/how-federal-hack-happened-448602)
  - [Threat actor leverages coin miner techniques to stay under the radar ‚Äì here‚Äôs how to spot them](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2020/11/30/threat-actor-leverages-coin-miner-techniques-to-stay-under-the-radar-heres-how-to-spot-them/)
 

**Lead (Lede)**
* Brief one or two sentence statement that opens the report
* Includes important aspects of the story
* Draws reader in

With the Politico news story we are learning that the reason why the adversary was able to access the U.S. government and exploit the supply chain is because "no one was looking in the right place". This provokes the reader to think about where is the right place, how did they do it? It encourages the reader to continue reading.

The Microsoft article's lead explains what cryptocurrency miners are, what is this threat and how does it take advantage of low-priority alerts.

**Nutgraf (short for nutshell paragraph)**
* The entire point of the story or report **in one paragraph**
* Describes what is new, important and why readers should care
* Nutgraf is like the Executive Summary
