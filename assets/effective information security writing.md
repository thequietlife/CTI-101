### Why writing scares us

* **Fear of not sounding competent** ‚Äì Overthinking leads to slow, overly complex writing.
* **Worry about missing key points** ‚Äì Anxiety over leaving something important out.
* **Self-doubt about writing ability** ‚Äì Feeling like a "bad writer."
* **Fear of being wrong** ‚Äì Concern about making mistakes or being incorrect.
* **Imposter syndrome** ‚Äì Feeling unqualified to write or share ideas.
  
### Overcoming a fear of writing
* The Prism Strategy
  - **Your perspective is unique** ‚Äì Even familiar topics gain new life through your lens
  - **Personal experience adds value** ‚Äì How you learned something matters as much as what you learned
  - **Originality comes from viewpoint** ‚Äì It‚Äôs not about being first, it‚Äôs about being *you*
  - **Your voice can be the one that makes it click** ‚Äì Even if others have covered the topic before
  - **Unique framing matters** ‚Äì Your approach may resonate where others didn‚Äôt
  - **Personal insight creates connection** ‚Äì Sharing how *you* understand something helps others understand it too
  - **Impact isn't about being first** ‚Äì It's about being relatable, clear, and human
* Set up an Advisory Board
  - find people who can review you writing but also people who you are okay with getting feedback from
* Keep a journal
  - Capture the crazy thoughts bouncing around
* Write more publicly

### Why is communication important?
* Wide range of writing we do:
  - status reports
  - case notes
  - meeting notes
  - slack chat
  - email etc
* We spend 20-30% of our day on communication related tasks
* So we need to do it well, e.g. "I get frustrated that the organisations I assess don't ever implement my recommendations, even a year or more after I compromise their network" - this can be remedied by **becoming more convincing** in your writing

### On writing
* Your writing lasts a long time, e.g your investigation notes may be referred to down the track by others
* Once you write something, the words belong to your reader and their meaning can change
* How you express your findings and your technical work will dictate a portion of your future success
