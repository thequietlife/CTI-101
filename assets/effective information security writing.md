### Why writing scares us

* **Fear of not sounding competent** – Overthinking leads to slow, overly complex writing.
* **Worry about missing key points** – Anxiety over leaving something important out.
* **Self-doubt about writing ability** – Feeling like a "bad writer."
* **Fear of being wrong** – Concern about making mistakes or being incorrect.
* **Imposter syndrome** – Feeling unqualified to write or share ideas.
  
### Overcoming a fear of writing
* The Prism Strategy
  - **Your perspective is unique** – Even familiar topics gain new life through your lens
  - **Personal experience adds value** – How you learned something matters as much as what you learned
  - **Originality comes from viewpoint** – It’s not about being first, it’s about being *you*
  - **Your voice can be the one that makes it click** – Even if others have covered the topic before
  - **Unique framing matters** – Your approach may resonate where others didn’t
  - **Personal insight creates connection** – Sharing how *you* understand something helps others understand it too
  - **Impact isn't about being first** – It's about being relatable, clear, and human
* Set up an Advisory Board
  - find people who can review you writing but also people who you are okay with getting feedback from
* Keep a journal
