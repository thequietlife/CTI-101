### Why writing scares us

* **Fear of not sounding competent** – Overthinking leads to slow, overly complex writing.
* **Worry about missing key points** – Anxiety over leaving something important out.
* **Self-doubt about writing ability** – Feeling like a "bad writer."
* **Fear of being wrong** – Concern about making mistakes or being incorrect.
* **Imposter syndrome** – Feeling unqualified to write or share ideas.
  
### Overcoming a fear of writing
* The Prism Strategy
* **Your perspective is unique** – Even familiar topics gain new life through your lens.
* **Personal experience adds value** – How you learned something matters as much as what you learned.
* **Originality comes from viewpoint** – It’s not about being first, it’s about being *you*.
