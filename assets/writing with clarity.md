🟩 Audience <br>
🟩 Structure <br>
🟩 Message <br>


### 01 | The Lede

🟦 Clarity <br>
🟦 Influence <br>
🟦 Story <br>
🟦 Grammar <br>

🟦 🪟 Clarity <br>

* Rapid communication
* Less frustrating
* Fewer mistakes
* Burying the lede - putting the important thing too far down
* 🏀 Think of a coach's game plan to the players during a time out in the last minute of a game

🟦 Influence & change <br>

* Bad products sell with good marketing
* Good products fail with bad marketing
* So, market your ideas
* Build your reputation
* Become known for signal, not noise

* Win hearts and minds
* Risk reduction
* Compliance increase
* Galvanise security’s “weakest link” 

🟦 Story <br>

* Filter out information
* Use pathos (emotion)
* Stories are really effective
* Stories are remembered easier than a paper with just facts
* Stories trigger a dopamine release that prompts concentration and interest
* Vulnerabilities lead to exploits to breaches ➡️ **consequences** on people's lives - people with money, businesses getting closed down - these are the sort of things that you can tap into
* **Translate your technical severe findings into something that really resonates**
* Surprise is an amazing thing to use. We solidify our memories after moments of surprise - a daring thing you did as a child - a shock that gets stuck in your memory 
* Be unexpected - an air hostess saying if not enough masks drop down pick your favourite kid and everyone laughed
* "Non-fiction can be every bit as exciting as fiction" Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t, Steven Pressfield
* Read a lot. Write a lot
* Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft **"The only way to be a great writer is to read a lot, write a lot"**
* Read - not blogs, articles that a cadet got beaten to write properly
* **Writer’s block? Read, physical exercise (run), rest, rewrite (Little Miss Sunshine was rewritten 100 times)**
* “Vigorous writing is concise...every word [should earn its place] tell”  [The Elements of Style, William Strunk](https://www.amazon.com.au/Elements-Style-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X) - Every word should earn its place.
* Delete, delete

* “The first draft of anything is shit” Hemmingway
* Second, third drafts still miserable but that's ok

🟦 Grammar <br>
* Tools
  - Microsoft > Word > Options > Proofing > Grammar Settings > Writing Style > Grammar and Refinements > Tick all
  - Grammarly
* Grammar is a bore. Grammar is amazing. Grammar guides your reader
* Start with the basics: when to use commas, apostrophes
* 🚦 🛑 Grammar is the sign post that guides the reader - when they need to take a mental breath
  

### 02 | The Body

* Good communication can be broken into three parts: audience, structure, message 

🟩 Audience <br>
🟩 Structure <br>
🟩 Message <br>


🟩 Audience <br>
* “The audience is the judge“ Aristotle - 👑 the audience is the king, someone that you need to influence
* **Who is your reader?** A newspaper has sections on politics, sport and knows those readers, each is a distinct reader
* Aim is to communicate with them not at them

**Audience** can be broken up into three parts:

1️⃣ Knowledge <br>
2️⃣ Priorities <br>
3️⃣ Tone <br>

1️⃣ **Knowledge**: 
* Understand what your reader definitely knows e.g. acronyms
* Exposure 
* Bias and opinions

🏈 The Knowledge Gap: Ron Aldridge (?) in the 1960s was tasked with growing interest in college football. He figured out how to make people care about college football. He realised it was the knowledge gap that was the problem.
 - Give them the backstory, the backstory of the star quarterback
 - Talk about the rivalries, why there were tensions between the quarterbacks
 - The camera would pan to the biggest supporters in crowd. This is still done now
 - This approach became the default

* Define the term - e.g. denial of service attacks - a distributed denial of the service attack is ...  - quick defn
* Give a quick definition
* Requisite back story

**Exposure** - understand a reader's exposure to material and bring them on the learning journey: bring them into the fold a little bit <br>
**Bias and opinions** - a reader with a strong stance on something might be harder to get them to listen <br>

2️⃣ **Priorities**<br>
* Agenda
* KPIs
* Operating style

Everyone has an agenda, the thing that is important to them. They might not be a regular user and not understand that much. Work with that. <br>

3️⃣ **Tone** <br>
* Professional
* Technical
* General

* For execs every minute counts, costs money. Get to the point quickly.
* Email from CISO to CEO - this is what I need you to do, is up front and underneath is the explanation

🟩 Structure <br>
* Story, report, email, all communication structure 
* Sentence structure


**Story/Comms Structure**
* Think of building a house - get the foundations right, done first. Sentence structure is fitting out the floors 
  - Guide your reader: story structure guides your comms
  - Save them time “Bradman Dead” front page newspaper - USE for email subject line. They don't necessarily need to read the email, that has given the reader enough info. It is not about the number of 'views' like with YouTube. Your aim is to let the reader leave at the earliest point. It is a courtesy - to save them time and avoid confusion. Don’t bury the lede. **Do not bury the most important thing below a sentence at the start** that doesn't tell them anything they might give up and never read that critical bit
  - 😶‍🌫️ Avoid confusion

**Inverted pyramid of journalism**

alt="funnel shape with the headline, the lead, the body, the tail" width="300"/>

- The most important information is first
- The headline is your email subject line, report title, e.g. "Bradman Dead"
- The first two sentences are the most important. Spend 80% time on this
- The curse of knowledge is a killer for good communication. It can be hard for an expert to communicate something. How to get around it: "Get to know the wants and desires of your audience in order to get them to act", Ben and Kelly Decker, Communicate to Influence

From BSides Melb presentation:

The Queen's death: Two newspaper articles showing story structure - headline, lead, body and tail.

**Sentence structure**
- Break up your writing
- New idea, new sentence
- 🍎 🍏 different coloured apples can go in the same sentence
- 🍏 🍊 apples and oranges go in different sentences
- New group of ideas, new paragraph
- Avoid a page of text. Use enter key a lot to break up text
- Identify the subject, use the grammar tools in Microsoft Word or grammarly
- **Write active not passive. Use this: ⚽ Darren kicked the ball**
- Not this: The ball was kicked by Darren
- Put effort in the email that the report is being attached to
- Keep it simple

**Message**
Keep it short and simple. Makes it easier to digest
* Concise
  - Use clear, concrete language 
  - Never be vague e.g. Not a number of incidences - **how many?**
- Don’t use cliches
- Limit acronyms e.g. CIA is ok but limit for lesser known ones like DDoS

**Concise**
Start reports with:
- Key takeaway
- In brief - provide a summary of the report in bullet points at the start of the report
- Speed read - add reading time e.g. 6 minute read to learn all about xyz

**Langauge**
* Avoid corporate slogans
* Use natural, concrete language
    - ✅ Bunnings slogan was "Lowest Prices Are Just The Beginning"
    - ✅ Southwest airlines "Low fares. No hidden fees" - sticky seats, bad food that's ok because it was so cheap. Your expectations are met. It sets the mood of the organisation
    - ❌ American Airlines "Going for Great". Everyone will have a different interpretation of "great"

### 03 | Publish

alt="workshop: 5 bullet points about a truck crashing and carrying prawns for Christmas" width="300"/>

All of the above are relevant facts but we need to put our audience first.
- traffic conditions really bad, take a different route

alt="A longer article about the crash with a spot on headline about price of prawns to skyrocket due to crash" width="300"/>

Again all about putting our audience first.
It is all about the Christmas lunch. No prawns.

**Closing**
If you follow the structures. Read, read, read. You'll become a great writer.
Practice. Tenacity. Thick skin.
