**Notes from Darren Pauli's BSides Melbourne 2022 and AusCERT 2023 presentations**

### 1. The Lede

🟦 Clarity <br>
🟦 Influence <br>
🟦 Story <br>
🟦 Grammar <br>

🟦 🪟 Clarity <br>

* Rapid communication
* Less frustrating
* Fewer mistakes
* Burying the lede - putting the important thing too far down
* 🏀 Think of a coach's game plan to the players during a time out in the last minute of a game

🟦 Influence & change <br>

* Bad products sell with good marketing
* Good products fail with bad marketing
* So, market your ideas
* Build your reputation
* Become known for signal, not noise

* Win hearts and minds
* Risk reduction
* Compliance increase
* Galvanise security’s “weakest link” 

🟦 Story <br>

* Filter out information
* Use pathos (emotion)
* Stories are really effective
* Stories are remembered easier than a paper with just facts
* Stories trigger a dopamine release that prompts concentration and interest
* Vulnerabilities lead to exploits to breaches ➡️ **consequences** on people's lives - people with money, businesses getting closed down - these are the sort of things that you can tap into
* **Translate your technical severe findings into something that really resonates**
* Surprise is an amazing thing to use. We solidify our memories after moments of surprise - a daring thing you did as a child - a shock that gets stuck in your memory 
* Be unexpected - an air hostess saying if not enough masks drop down pick your favourite kid and everyone laughed
* "Non-fiction can be every bit as exciting as fiction" Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t, Steven Pressfield
* Read a lot. Write a lot
* Stephen King, On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft **"The only way to be a great writer is to read a lot, write a lot"**
* Read - not blogs, articles that a cadet got beaten to write properly
* **Writer’s block? Read, physical exercise (run), rest, rewrite (Little Miss Sunshine was rewritten 100 times)**
* “Vigorous writing is concise...every word [should earn its place] tell”  [The Elements of Style, William Strunk](https://www.amazon.com.au/Elements-Style-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X) - Every word should earn its place.
* Delete, delete

* “The first draft of anything is shit” Hemmingway
* Second, third drafts still miserable but that's ok

🟦 Grammar <br>
* Tools
  - Microsoft > Word > Options > Proofing > Grammar Settings > Writing Style > Grammar and Refinements > Tick all
  - Grammarly
* Grammar is a bore. Grammar is amazing. Grammar guides your reader
* Start with the basics: when to use commas, apostrophes
* 🚦 🛑 Grammar is the sign post that guides the reader - when they need to take a mental breath
