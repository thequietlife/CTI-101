### 01. The Lede

🟦 🪟 Clarity <br>
🟦 Story <br>
🟦 Influence <br>
🟦 Grammar <br>


🟦 🪟 Clarity <br>

* Rapid communication
* Less frustrating
* Fewer mistakes
* Burying the lede
* 🏀 Think of a coach's game plan to the players during a time out in the last minute of a game

- Influence and changes

* Bad products sell with good marketing
* Good products fail with bad marketing
* So, market your ideas
* Build your rep.
* Becomes known for signal, not noise

* Win hearts and minds
* Risk reduction
* Compliance increase
* Galvanise security’s “weakest link” 


🟦 Story

* Filter out information
* Use pathos (emotion)
* Be unexpected. Surprise
* Read a lot. Write a lot. (Stephen King on writing: "The only way to be a great writer is to read a lot, write a lot."
* Read - not blogs, articles that a cadet got beaten to write properly
* Writer’s block? Read, run, rest, 
* Rewrite (Little Miss Sunshine was rewritten 100 times)


“Vigorous writing is concise...every word [should] tell”  [The Elements of Style, William Strunk](https://www.amazon.com.au/Elements-Style-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X)

* Every word should earn its space
