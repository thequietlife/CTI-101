## Networking Fundamentals

### The OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnenction (OSI) Model is a universal language for computer networking. It explains how different computer systems communicate with each other. It breaks down a complex topic into seven segments. Each layer has a specific job and communicates with the layers above and below.

The OSI model is used for understanding and troubleshooting networking problems. It provides a methodical approach. Issues can be pinpointed and fixed more efficiently.




| Number      | Layers   | Protocol data unit | Role |
| :---    |    :----:   |   ---    | -- |
| 7 | Application | Data | -- |
| 6 | Presentation | Data | -- |
| 5 | Session| Data | -- |
| 4 | Transport | Segment | -- | 
| 3 | Network | Packet | -- |
| 2 | Data link | Frame| -- |
| 1 | Physical | Bit | -- |
