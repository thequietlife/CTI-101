## Networking Fundamentals

### The OSI Model

The Open Systems Interconnenction (OSI) Model is a universal language for computer networking. It explains how different computer systems communicate with each other. It breaks down a complex topic into seven segments. Each layer has a specific job and communicates with the layers above and below.

The OSI model is used for understanding and troubleshooting networking problems. It provides a methodical approach. Issues can be pinpointed and fixed more efficiently.




| Number      | Layer | Example    |
| :---        |    :----:   |   -----------     |
| 1   | Physical       | data cables     |
| 2   | Data Link       | --     |
| 3   | Network       | --   |
| 4   | Transport       | --    |
| 5   | Session      | --   |
| 6   | Presentation       | --    |
| 7   | Application   | --    |
