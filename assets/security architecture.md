## üìê Security Architecture

### What is Security Architecture?
It is the strategic design of systems to protect, information and ensure its integrity, confidentiality and availability against threats

### Main Objectives of Security Architecture?
To reduce the risk of security breaches and protect organisations from threats

### Five Security Principles to Follow (and One to Avoid)
#### 1. Defence in Depth <br>
Aims to provide a number of layers to thwart a threat actor. Like American Ninja Warrior.

Don't rely on one single security mechanism to keep the network safe. 
üè∞ Think of a castle, a building with thick, high walls. Built robustly to keep the kingdom safe.

But it needed a door. And the door added a weakness to the castle. Security was added with a bolt and gate. But that didn't provide enough protection.

So a moat was added to give an extra layer of security. üêä And crocodiles.

A system of security mechanisms.

alt="following on from the previous image. shows what mechanisms can be put in place" width="800"/>

üõ°Ô∏è Modern security takes a layered approach like the olde worlde castle example. We are not relying on one tool to do all the protecting. Each part of a network can have tools added to it. For example, MFA, MDM, EDR, firewalls, vulnerability testing, üîí encryption. <br>

#### 2. Least Privilege <br>
Giving people access to only what they need to do their job and only for as long as they need that access. For example giving an employee access to only the floor they work on rather than access to all floors of the building.
